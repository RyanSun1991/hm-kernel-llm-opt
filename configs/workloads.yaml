# Define reproducible workloads for profiling + optimization.
# Each workload should specify:
# - how to run
# - what metrics to collect
# - what success criteria mean

workloads:
  - name: ui_frame_stability
    kind: system_trace
    command: "scripts/run_workload_ui_frame.sh"
    artifacts:
      - type: framegraph
        path: "outputs/framegraph.json"
      - type: hitrace
        path: "outputs/hitrace.trace"
    objectives:
      - metric: "fps"
        goal: "maximize"
      - metric: "jank_rate"
        goal: "minimize"
